# Project Image Placeholder

This directory contains placeholder project images. Replace these with actual project screenshots:

- `project1.jpg` - E-commerce Platform screenshot
- `project2.jpg` - Task Management App screenshot  
- `project3.jpg` - Weather Dashboard screenshot

Recommended image specifications:
- Format: JPG or WebP for best performance
- Dimensions: 600x400px (3:2 aspect ratio)
- File size: < 200KB each
- Quality: 80-85% compression

For best performance, consider using:
1. WebP format with JPG fallback
2. Responsive images with srcset
3. Lazy loading (already implemented)
4. Image optimization tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG
